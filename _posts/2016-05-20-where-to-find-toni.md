Hi there, and welcome. I'm Toni, and I write, think, read, and make beautiful and useful things in gorgeous Austin, Texas. Here's where you can find me around the web. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c49f83a4984409f5f1d674d8e6b5fc1591ac7d70.png)

[Miss Red Pen][0]: This is where I do résumé writing along wth editing, proofreading, and other services to help effectively tell your unique personal, professional, or small business story.

[Red Pen Travelers][1]: Here's where I create completely customized, lovingly handcrafted leather notebooks that showcase your personal style and local pride.

[Miss Merryheart Aprons][2]: I designed the unique and completely original Retro Ripple Apron pattern, available as an [instant download][3] so you can print it at home and start sewing today.

Want to get in touch about something else? I'd love to hear from you. Send your mail to toni at toni gatlin dot com.
